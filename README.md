# Engineering Thesis 

This repository contains the source code for my engineering thesis project. The project focuses on creating 3D visualization for interior design using Three.js and Angular on frontend, and Node.js and express on backend.

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: Contains the Angular application for 3D visualization.
- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js and express server for handling API requests.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd engineering_thesis
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install

    cd ../backend
    npm install

4. Run the frontend and backend servers:
   - For frontend:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        npm start
        ```

    - For backend:
        ```bash
        cd ../backend
        npx nodemon src/index.js
        ```

## Technologies Used
- Frontend:
    - Angular
    - Three.js
- Backend:
